									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>In major cities across the world, understanding transportation behaviors is a critical task for city planning and investments. 
										This project will visualize key spatial and temporal trends associated with transportation, specifically recorded activities within the 5th Ring Road of Beijing. 
										Beijing is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, and is host to a sophisticated and robust transportation network. 
										While the focus of this project will be on Beijing, insights gained will likely apply generally to other cities.</p>

								<h2>Conclusions</h2>
								<p>In conclusion, it's clear that time, location, and mode of transportation have notable impacts on transportation activities in Beijing's 5th Ring Road.</p>
								<p>More specifically, the amount of concurrent travelers and the longest duration of travel peaks in May and then in September and October. This aligns to changing weather and issues with pollution during the summer months. Similarly, mid-morning around 0900 and in the evening between 1900 and 2100 have the greatest amount of concurrent travelers, aligning with conventional work hours. Somewhat surprisingly, there was more travelon the weekends, namely Friday and Saturday, as compared to the work week, signaling an issue with weekend construction.</p>
								<p>When looking at trends geographically, the yearly pattern of travel spikes in the late summer and early fall aligns with Chinese national public holidays. The two largest holidays of the year are the Mid-Autumn Festival (September) and National Day (October). Chinese employers typically provide less paid time off than American employers, but public holidays are typically paid time off from work and sometimes last for one to two weeks. Many Chinese take this opportunity to travel and visit family. Before these long periods of time off, many companies will work extended hours -- late nights and through the weekends -- in the weeks leading up to the holiday. Geographically, it's also easy to see where modes of transportation are more or less common. Bus routes cover the city and are well-utilized by citizens. Bicycles are also well-used, as well as walking, moreso in Beijing's University district and near the Olympic Stadium and Beijing's largest inner-city public park. Subways are well-used in the city, and trains are more used on the outskirts. Cars and taxis are also well-used.</p>
								<p>With composition, the percentage of travel records associated with walking is generally the highest with the exception of July and August, where bus travel recordings are greatest, and January and February, when biking is highest followed by driving. As with activity levels, the change in proportion of bus usage aligns with high temperatires and pollution. The use of bikes in the winter months is slightly surprising, but the absolute value of travel is extremely limited. Walkers tend to make up the greatest percentage of travel on the weekends, with bus and bike riders accounting for most of the transportation during the weekdays. Finally, walkers and bikers make up the greatest percentage of travelers during the work hours, with most travelers riding the bus in the early morning prior to the start of the workday. That said, any construction or upgrades would still be most ideal between 1 and 6 in the morning, as the absolute activity is extremely low across all transportation types.</p>
